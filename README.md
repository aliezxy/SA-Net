#SA-Net
This is a deep learning method used for predicting the RBP binding sites.
We comprehensively evaluate SA-Net on RBP-24.
The dataset download from http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/GraphProt.
The SA-Net model was implemented using Python 3.8.8, TensorFlow 2.7.0, and Keras 2.7.0 libraries.
